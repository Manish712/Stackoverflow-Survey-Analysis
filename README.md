# Business understanding

This project focuses on the most unusual and curious questions made since the beginning of the surveys. Besides that, I used this opportunity to implement some data visualisation best practises. The analysis was carried out by taking raw data from 2020 and previous years,exploring and processing it in a Jupyter Notebook with Python, and then plotting the graphs with the Matplotlib library.

Here are a few questions to the 2020 database I prompted:

Question 1: Which were the most popular programming language in 2020?

Question 2: Which languages are the most people interested to learn over the next year?

Question 3: Which are the most loved languages?
